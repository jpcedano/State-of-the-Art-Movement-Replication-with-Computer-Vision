# State-of-the-Art-Movement-Replication-with-Computer-Vision
The goal of this project is to control a simulated robotic arm using real-time color detection. Control is performed by detecting a specific colored object through a camera, allowing the simulation of the robotic arm to be manipulated in a Pygame environment.
